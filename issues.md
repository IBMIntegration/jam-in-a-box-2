# Issues

## TODOs

These are things that must be done to go live.

- Create the environment configuration that actually uses the TechZone environment with my scripts.
- How to handle credit -- I'm worried if I name the people who created the labs, they will become the support focal point for the whole world?
- Image sizing -- I need to constrain them to the size of the page. I also need to put marigns around them.
- Fix numbering before publishing anything.

These are things I should do soon

- Apply Carbon 11 styles to all web properties.

## Must-fix issues

These issues are highest priority and must be fixed before going live

- The MQSC script is preventing MQ from starting in the MQ lab -- get help from Eddy.

## Lower priority issues

Medium priority issues are displayed in **boldface**.

### Assistant

- **markdown-it does not create the anchors so tables of contents do not work.**
- **There should be a link to the openshift console**
- Need a better way to handle 404s.

### Platform Navigator

- The default theme is Dark -- I want to set it to the system theme.
- The Tech Zone environment provides a queue manager in the Platform Navigator. It should be removed.
