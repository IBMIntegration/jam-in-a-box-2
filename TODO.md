# TODOs to complete the Jam in a Box

Based on lab materials for 2025 ([Box folder](https://ibm.ent.box.com/folder/317175414667))

## ACE

### Connector Development Kit lab

Lab material needs to be reformatted. One continuous page cases usability issues.

Provide materials:

1. petstore.yaml
1. pet-store.svg

Lab issues

1. Lab shows it being done in the cloud. Can we do this on-prem?

### ACE Discovery Connectors

Lab material needs to be reformatted. One continuous page cases usability issues.

1. Uses a local toolkit? Provide download link?

### ACE Discovery Lab

Official format, should be used on all labs

1. Users logs in to get API Keys
1. User requires a GitHub account, clones a repo from IBM

## EDA

All the labs are readable but they should use the same template as the ACE Discovery Lab

### EDA Lab 1

Material protected, cannot read

### EDA Lab 2.1

Requires local Java. Written for Windows, so we'll need to either test on macOS and Linux or provide remote desktop.

### EDA Lab 2.2

No external dependencies

### EDA Lab 3

No external dependencies, just EDA and EEM

## Integration Assembly

1. "_Secrets and Configuration for barauth, salesforce & slack connection and apic connection are pre-created in all individual student namespaces._" -- does this represent an external dependency? Do I need to provide these?
1. Preëxisting ACE flow with BAR file in a public Git repo

## MQ

### MQ Intro Lab 1

Material protected, cannot read

### MQ Intro Lab 2

Official format, but this one could benefit from baing generated online because
of command lines that depend on the environment.

1. Requires MQ Client on local machin
1. `oc` CLI on local machine
1. Lab 1 completed
